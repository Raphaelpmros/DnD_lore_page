                            agency locked in eternal struggle against its antithesis. Only good and evil exist. And not

                            and became the ally and enemy of many famous adventurers, including Mordenkainen. In time,

                            even ruled as the Witch Queen and went by many names, most notably Iggwilv, a figure of

                        <p>A man of noble birth, Strahd spent much of his life serving causes of goodness and law, most
                            notably
                            as a warrior and leader of armies. Years of such service took their toll upon him however,
                            and by
                            the time he reached middle age, Strahd came to believe he had squandered his life and his
                            youth.
                            With this dark mood upon him, he came to conquer the region known as Barovia, and assumed
                            lordship
                            there, taking as his residence the pre-existing castle known as Ravenloft. From this
                            position of
                            power and security, he called for members of his family "long unseated from their ancestral
                            thrones"
                            to join him, including a younger brother named Sergei.

                            Some time after this reunion, the Count himself fell in love with a young Barovian woman,
                            Tatyana,
                            though she rejected his affections in favor of the younger Sergei. Filled with despair and
                            jealousy,
                            and brooding a growing hatred for Sergei, Strahd sought magical means to restore his youth.
                            In a
                            moment of desperate frustration, he "made a pact with death - a pact of blood." On the day
                            of Sergei
                            and Tatyana's wedding, Strahd murdered his brother and pursued the grieving Tatyana until
                            she flung
                            herself from the walls of Ravenloft. Strahd himself was shot down by the arrows of the
                            castle guard.
                            Even so, he did not die, but went on to rule the land of Barovia as a vampire. </p>

                            miniature giant space hamster (a.k.a., a regular hamster) known as Boo, who doesn't talk.
                            Minsc
                            hails from Rashemen, Boo from Wildspace. Both became fixtures in Baldur's Gate—literally.

                            After defeating evil forces threatening Baldur's Gate, Minsc and Boo allowed themselves to
                            be
                            petrified and placed in the middle of a market square in the Upper City—until such time as
                            heroes
                            were needed once more. While they were statues, Minsc and Boo didn't age. After being struck
                            by wild
                            magic, Minsc and Boo reverted to flesh and resumed their heroic ways.

                            They are currently members of an adventuring party called the Heroes of Baldur's Gate. This
                            group
                            has traveled up and down the Sword Coast, and even traveled to Ravenloft and the Nine Hells.
